**Hotel Management Network Model**

*Project Overview*

Welcome to the Hotel Management Network Model project! This project aims to create a robust and efficient computer network infrastructure for a hotel environment. The network design spans three floors, each equipped with its own router interconnected to form a seamless communication network. The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing algorithm has been employed to optimize routing within the network.

**Features**
1. Topology:
The network consists of three floors, each with its own router. The routers are interconnected to facilitate communication between different floors and departments.

2. VLAN Implementation:
Eight Virtual LANs (VLANs) have been created to segregate network traffic based on departments. This enhances network security and efficiency by logically grouping devices. Each VLAN corresponds to a different department within the hotel.

3. DHCP Integration:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) has been implemented to automate the assignment of IP addresses to end devices. If a device is configured with a static IP address, the system will dynamically switch it to DHCP for seamless network integration.

4. OSPF Routing Algorithm:
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing algorithm is utilized to optimize the routing process within the network. This dynamic routing protocol ensures efficient and fast routing of data packets between routers.

5. DNS Server:
A Domain Name System (DNS) server has been set up to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This is crucial for seamless communication between devices and services within the network.

6. Email Server:
An Email server has been incorporated to facilitate email communication within the hotel network. This server is essential for handling internal email communication efficiently.

**Implementation Details**
The network has been simulated and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project includes a comprehensive set of configurations for routers, switches, VLANs, DHCP, OSPF, DNS, and Email servers.

**Getting Started**
Import the project file into Cisco Packet Tracer.
Review the router configurations to understand the OSPF setup.
Explore the VLAN configurations for department-wise segregation.
Examine DHCP configurations on routers for automatic IP address assignment.
Check the DNS and Email server configurations for smooth communication services.
